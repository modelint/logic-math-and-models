How math, predicate logic and relational theory form the foundations of Shlaer-Mellor Executable UML

I've been meaning for some time to describe the frequently misunderstood foundational principles of the Shlaer-Mellor modeling methodology also known as Executable UML.

You won't find much in the code section since this repository is really all about the wiki and disucssion group.

I plan to start out writing and eventually create a series of fun 5-10 minute videos based on this work.

Feel free to ask questions and join the discussion group.
